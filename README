Usage
=====

To inject metric values for an arbitrary object 'device':

    from timegraph.models import Metric

    for metric in Metric.objects.all():
        value = request.POST.get(metric.parameter)
        if value:
            metric.set_polling(device, value)

To read back the value for a metric:

    from timegraph.models import Metric

    metric = Metric.objects.get(pk=123)
    metric.get_polling(device)

To plot a graph for the 'device' object:

    from timegraph.views import render_graph

    def graph_device(request, graph_slug, device_mac):
        """
        Renders the given graph for the given device.
        """
        device = get_object_or_404(Device, pk=device_mac)
        graph = get_object_or_404(Graph, slug=graph_slug)
        return render_graph(request, graph, device)
